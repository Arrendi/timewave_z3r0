The purpose of this software and project is to further
research started by Terence Mckenna and others.

The software open-sourced / public domain.

USAGE:

1) Unzip the software
2) Run "make"
3) Run the produced programs


== Examples: ==

Calculate the timewave from 100 days before zero-point
with 1 second resolution, at a wave-factor of 2.
Save the output to a file named timewave.csv

./twz 100 1 2 > timewave.csv

The timewave.csv file can then be opened in a spreadsheet program, 
such as OpenOffice, and graphed.
