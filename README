The purpose of this software and project is to further the
Timewave Zero research started by Terence Mckenna and others.
Calculates both with and without the infamous "Half Twist".

An in-depth explanation of the software can be found in a book 
called "The Invisible Landscape".
ISBN-10: 0062506358
ISBN-13: 978-0062506351


The software is open-sourced / public domain.

USAGE:

1) Unzip the software
2) Run "make"
3) Run the produced programs


== Example: ==

Calculate the timewave from 100 days before zero-point
with 0.1 second resolution, at a wave-factor of 2.
Save the output to a file named timewave.csv

./twz-generator 100 0.1 2 > timewave.csv

The timewave.csv file can then be opened in a spreadsheet program, 
such as OpenOffice, and graphed.


== Programs == 

 twz-point:
 Calculate the timewave value at a given point	

 twz-generator
 Calcluate a running timewave, useful for graphing.

 twz-generator-threaded
 Calcluate a running timewave using multiple calculation threads
 Useful for graphing on multicore computers


 
== Upgrades to the Original Code ==
 
 * Optimized code specifically for Intel/AMD x86_64 CPU's (most common today)
 * Better calculation precision than original code
 * 32-bit integer variables upgraded to 64-bit (uint64_t)
 * 64-bit floating point variables upgraded to extended-precision 80-bit (long double)
 * Switched floating-point calculations to SSE, freeing the FPU registers
 * Enabled MMX optimizations (uses freed FPU registers)
 * Make use of SSE2 CPU optimizations
